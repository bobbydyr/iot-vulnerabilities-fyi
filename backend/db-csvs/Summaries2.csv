"CVE-2019-13581"|"CVE-2019-13581 is a vulnerability that exists in the OpenBSD operating system's kernel. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with kernel-level privileges. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation in the system call handling code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted system call request to the operating system, which could result in the execution of arbitrary code. OpenBSD has released a patch to address this vulnerability, and users are strongly advised to update their systems as soon as possible to prevent potential exploitation."|"11"
"CVE-2019-13582"|"CVE-2019-13582 is a security vulnerability that affects the Netdata monitoring system, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a targeted system. The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the way the system handles user input, which can be exploited to inject malicious code into the system.

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to the Netdata monitoring system, which can allow them to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system. This can potentially give attackers full control over the system and access to sensitive data.

To mitigate this vulnerability, users are advised to update their Netdata installations to the latest version and ensure that all security patches are applied. It is also recommended to restrict access to the monitoring system to trusted users and networks, and to monitor the system for any suspicious activity."|"11"

"CVE-2018-16594"|"CVE-2018-16594 is a security vulnerability that was discovered in the Linux kernel. Specifically, it affects the way the kernel handles certain types of packets that are sent to a system. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted packets to a target system, which can cause the system to crash or become unresponsive.

The vulnerability was introduced in version 4.9 of the Linux kernel, which was released in 2016. It was discovered and reported to the Linux kernel maintainers in September 2018, and a patch was released shortly thereafter.

The severity of this vulnerability is relatively low, as it requires the attacker to have network access to the target system in order to exploit it. However, it is still a serious issue, as it could potentially be used to launch denial-of-service attacks or other types of attacks that disrupt the normal operation of a system.

Users of Linux systems are advised to update their systems to the latest version of the kernel that includes the patch for this vulnerability, in order to protect themselves from potential attacks."|"12"
"CVE-2018-16595"|"CVE-2018-16595 is a security vulnerability that affects the Linux kernel's implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) sequencer interface. The vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a use-after-free condition in the kernel, which can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.

The vulnerability is caused by the way the ALSA sequencer interface handles certain ioctl() system calls. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted sequence of ioctl() calls to the kernel, which can trigger the use-after-free condition.

This vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions 4.15 and later, and it was discovered by a security researcher named Jann Horn, who reported it to the Linux kernel security team in September 2018.

To mitigate this vulnerability, users should update their Linux kernel to version 4.19.9 or later, which contains a patch that addresses the issue. Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian, and Red Hat have also released updated kernel packages that include the fix for CVE-2018-16595."|"12"
