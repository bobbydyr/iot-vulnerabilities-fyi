The vulnerability was first discovered in August 2012 and was assigned CVE-2012-4248. It affects all versions of Apache Struts prior to version 2.3.1.1.

The vulnerability is caused by a lack of input validation in the Struts framework. This means that an attacker can submit specially crafted input to a Struts application, which can cause the application to execute arbitrary code.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would need to submit a specially crafted HTTP request to the Struts application. This request would need to contain a malicious payload that would be executed by the application.

The vulnerability was patched in Apache Struts version 2.3.1.1, which was released in August 2012. Users of Apache Struts are advised to upgrade to this version or later to protect themselves from this vulnerability.

Overall, CVE-2012-4248 is a serious security vulnerability that can allow an attacker to take control of a system running a vulnerable version of Apache Struts. It underscores the importance of keeping software up-to-date and implementing strong input validation in web applications."|"2""CVE-2010-5268"|"CVE-2010-5268 is a security vulnerability in the Linux kernel that was discovered in 2010. The vulnerability is related to the implementation of the Transparent Inter-Process Communication (TIPC) protocol in the kernel. 

The TIPC protocol is a communication protocol that allows processes on different machines to communicate with each other over a network. The vulnerability allows an attacker to crash the kernel by sending a specially crafted TIPC message to a vulnerable system. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack, where the system becomes unresponsive or crashes.

The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the WebLogic Server's Security Service that allows an attacker to bypass security restrictions and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the WebLogic Server. This vulnerability was assigned a CVSS score of 7.5, indicating that it is a high-severity vulnerability that should be patched as soon as possible. Oracle released a patch for this vulnerability in April 2012, and users are advised to update their systems as soon as possible to prevent exploitation."|"12""CVE-2018-16593"|"CVE-2018-16593 is a security vulnerability that was discovered in the OpenEMR system. OpenEMR is an open-source electronic health record (EHR) system that is used by healthcare providers to manage patient data. The vulnerability was identified in September 2018 and was rated as critical.

The vulnerability allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system by exploiting a remote code execution vulnerability in the system's PHPMailer library. The PHPMailer library is a third-party library that is used by OpenEMR to send emails.

The vulnerability affected versions of OpenEMR that were released prior to version 5.0.1.4. OpenEMR released a patch to fix the vulnerability in October 2018. Users were advised to update their systems as soon as possible to avoid any potential security breaches.

If the vulnerability was exploited, an attacker could gain access to sensitive patient data stored in the OpenEMR system. This data could include patient names, addresses, medical history, and other personal information. The exploitation of this vulnerability could have serious consequences for both patients and healthcare providers.

Healthcare providers were advised to take steps to prevent such vulnerabilities and to ensure that their systems were up-to-date with the latest patches and security updates. It is also recommended that healthcare providers implement best practices for data security, such as encrypting sensitive data and using strong passwords."|"12""CVE-2018-16594"|"CVE-2018-16594 is a security vulnerability that was discovered in the Linux kernel. Specifically, it affects the way the kernel handles certain types of packets that are sent to a system. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted packets to a target system, which can cause the system to crash or become unresponsive.

The vulnerability was introduced in version 4.9 of the Linux kernel, which was released in 2016. It was discovered and reported to the Linux kernel maintainers in September 2018, and a patch was released shortly thereafter.

The severity of this vulnerability is relatively low, as it requires the attacker to have network access to the target system in order to exploit it. However, it is still a serious issue, as it could potentially be used to launch denial-of-service attacks or other types of attacks that disrupt the normal operation of a system.

Users of Linux systems are advised to update their systems to the latest version of the kernel that includes the patch for this vulnerability, in order to protect themselves from potential attacks."|"12""CVE-2018-16595"|"CVE-2018-16595 is a security vulnerability that affects the Linux kernel's implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) sequencer interface. The vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a use-after-free condition in the kernel, which can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition or potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.

The vulnerability is caused by the way the ALSA sequencer interface handles certain ioctl() system calls. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted sequence of ioctl() calls to the kernel, which can trigger the use-after-free condition.

This vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions 4.15 and later, and it was discovered by a security researcher named Jann Horn, who reported it to the Linux kernel security team in September 2018.

To mitigate this vulnerability, users should update their Linux kernel to version 4.19.9 or later, which contains a patch that addresses the issue. Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian, and Red Hat have also released updated kernel packages that include the fix for CVE-2018-16595."|"12""CVE-2018-11314"|"CVE-2018-11314 is a security vulnerability that affects Cisco WebEx Meetings Server versions 2.6 and earlier. The vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with elevated privileges. 

This vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation of user-supplied data in the web interface of the affected software. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected server. If successful, the attacker can gain access to sensitive information or execute arbitrary code on the server with elevated privileges.

To mitigate this vulnerability, Cisco has released a software update that addresses the issue. Users are advised to update their software to the latest version as soon as possible. Additionally, users should ensure that their systems are protected by firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and other security measures to prevent unauthorized access to their systems."|"13"
